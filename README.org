* Forest Dream video

This is an interactive music video for the song "forest dream":

https://soundcloud.com/joakimv/forest-dream

The song was made with overtone, so using Quil for the video seemed
like an interesting idea.



* Usage

Emacs - run cider, open `core.clj` and press `C-c C-k` to evaluate the file.

REPL - run `(require 'my-sketch.core)`.

keys a and s change direction in the forest journey

keys 1,2, etc produce scenes corresponding to the lyrics.
key 0 reset the scene. (basically its just an image that zooms by)
